# Text-RPG
I'm building a simple RPG to practice my coding!

The goal of this project is to have an RPG that:
1. Allows the player to battle a set of 2-3 enemies.
2. Allows the player to select from different "weapons" to hit enemy weaknesses
3. Allows the player to "negotiate" with the enemy, avoiding conflict altogether.

The goal of this project from a javascript standpoint is to:
1. Use the HTML Canvas to build enemies.
2. Then learn to swap the enemies with original art from the canvas build version.
2. Create a seamless transition between dialogue options.
3. Allow for multiple inputs (space bar and arrow keys, as well as number inputs and mouse clicks).
4. Create a control flow that consists of:
  a. Intro dialogue
  b. Battle
  c. Player turn
  d. Enemy turn
  e. if player or enemy defeated -> victory/win screen.
  f. play again button
  
  Will update with more details later.
